# Compact Study Generator Cache Fix

## Problem Description

The compact study generator was returning the same content regardless of which files were uploaded. This was happening because of an aggressive caching mechanism in the file processing system that was using file metadata (name, size, modification time, type) to generate cache keys instead of actual file content.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `FileProcessingCache` class in `backend/lib/file-processing/cache.ts`. The `generateFileHash` method was creating hashes based on file properties that could be identical for different files:

```typescript
// OLD - Problematic approach
private async generateSimpleHash(file: File): Promise<string> {
  const text = `${file.name}_${file.size}_${file.lastModified}_${file.type}`;
  // ... hash generation based only on metadata
}
```

This meant that if you uploaded different PDF files with the same name, size, and modification time, they would get the same cache key and return cached content from the first file processed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Hash Generation

Modified the cache to generate hashes based on actual file content:

- **Primary method**: Uses Web Crypto API to hash the actual file content (SHA-256)
- **Fallback method**: Reads a sample of file content + metadata + timestamp + random number for uniqueness

```typescript
// NEW - Content-based approach
private async generateContentBasedHash(file: File): Promise<string> {
  // Read file content sample for hashing
  const sampleSize = Math.min(8192, file.size);
  const buffer = await file.slice(0, sampleSize).arrayBuffer();
  // ... hash both content and metadata with timestamp for uniqueness
}
```

### 2. Disabled Caching for Compact Study Generator

Modified the `EnhancedContentExtractor` to disable caching when processing files for the compact study generator:

```typescript
// Use enhanced processing with cache disabled
const result = await FileProcessing.processFileEnhanced(file, {
  useCache: false, // Disable cache to ensure each file is processed fresh
  trackProgress: true,
  manageMemory: true,
  priority: 'high'
});
```

### 3. Cache Clearing on Each Request

Added automatic cache clearing at the start of each compact study generation request:

```typescript
// Clear file processing cache to ensure fresh content extraction
const { clearGlobalCache } = await import("@/backend/lib/file-processing");
clearGlobalCache();
```

### 4. Manual Cache Management

Added tools for manual cache management:

- **API endpoint**: `/api/generate-compact-study/clear-cache` (POST to clear, GET for stats)
- **UI button**: "Clear Cache" button in the compact study generator interface
- **Test script**: `test-cache-fix.js` to verify the fix works

## Files Modified

1. `backend/lib/file-processing/cache.ts` - Enhanced hash generation
2. `backend/lib/compact-study/enhanced-content-extractor.ts` - Disabled caching
3. `app/api/generate-compact-study/route.ts` - Auto cache clearing
4. `components/compact-study-generator.tsx` - Added clear cache button
5. `app/api/generate-compact-study/clear-cache/route.ts` - Cache management endpoint

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:

```bash
node test-cache-fix.js
```

This script will:
1. Process multiple different files through the compact study generator
2. Compare the outputs to ensure they're different
3. Report whether the cache fix is working correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- Each uploaded file should be processed fresh, regardless of file metadata
- Different files should produce different study guide content
- The cache will still work for performance optimization but won't cause content conflicts
- Users can manually clear the cache if needed

## Performance Considerations

- Disabling cache for compact study generation may slightly increase processing time
- Content-based hashing requires reading file content, which adds minimal overhead
- The benefits of correct content extraction outweigh the small performance cost

## Monitoring

- Check the cache statistics via the API endpoint: `GET /api/generate-compact-study/clear-cache`
- Monitor processing times to ensure performance remains acceptable
- Watch for any new caching-related issues in the logs
