# Topic Selection Guide

## Overview

The topic selection phase is where you review AI-organized content and choose what to include in your compact study material. This is your opportunity to customize the content while maintaining fidelity to your original materials.

## Understanding AI Topic Organization

### How Topics Are Created
- **Content Analysis**: AI analyzes your uploaded files to identify main themes and concepts
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Content is organized into main topics and subtopics
- **Context Preservation**: Original wording and meaning are maintained
- **Source Tracking**: Each topic shows which files it came from

### Topic Structure
```
Main Topic: Calculus Derivatives
├── Subtopic: Basic Rules
├── Subtopic: Chain Rule
├── Subtopic: Product Rule
└── Subtopic: Practice Problems
```

### Confidence Scores
- **High (90-100%)**: Very confident topic organization
- **Medium (70-89%)**: Good organization, may need review
- **Low (50-69%)**: Uncertain organization, should be reviewed

## Topic Selection Interface

### Topic List View
- **Checkboxes**: Select/deselect topics for inclusion
- **Preview Content**: See topic content and examples
- **Source Information**: View which files contributed to each topic
- **Page Estimate**: Real-time estimate of pages needed

### Content Preview
- **Original Text**: Extracted content from your files
- **Images**: Visual examples and diagrams
- **Source Context**: Where content came from in original files
- **Edit Options**: Modify content while preserving meaning

## Selection Strategies

### For Comprehensive Coverage
- **Select All Relevant Topics**: Include all topics that relate to your study goals
- **Balance Detail and Breadth**: Choose topics that provide good coverage
- **Include Examples**: Select topics with practice problems and examples
- **Consider Dependencies**: Include prerequisite topics for complex concepts

### For Focused Study
- **Prioritize Key Concepts**: Select only the most important topics
- **Focus on Weak Areas**: Choose topics you need to study most
- **Include Practice**: Prioritize topics with examples and exercises
- **Limit Scope**: Select fewer topics for more detailed coverage

### For Quick Reference
- **Essential Facts Only**: Select topics with key formulas and definitions
- **Skip Detailed Explanations**: Focus on concise reference information
- **Include Visual Aids**: Select topics with helpful diagrams and charts
- **Prioritize Frequently Used**: Choose topics you'll reference most often

## Content Editing Guidelines

### When to Edit Content
- **Too Verbose**: Content is longer than needed for compact format
- **Missing Key Points**: Important information was not extracted properly
- **Unclear Wording**: AI organization changed meaning or clarity
- **Redundant Information**: Multiple topics contain the same information

### How to Edit Effectively
- **Preserve Original Meaning**: Keep the intent and accuracy of source material
- **Maintain Technical Terms**: Don't change specialized vocabulary
- **Focus on Key Points**: Highlight the most important information
- **Use Bullet Points**: Convert paragraphs to concise bullet points

### Content Editing Best Practices
```
Original: "The derivative of a function f(x) with respect to x represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function at any given point, and it can be calculated using various rules including the power rule, product rule, and chain rule."

Edited: "Derivative = instantaneous rate of change
• Power rule: d/dx[x^n] = nx^(n-1)
• Product rule: d/dx[uv] = u'v + uv'
• Chain rule: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))·g'(x)"
```

## Page Count Management

### Understanding Page Estimates
- **Dynamic Calculation**: Estimate updates as you select/deselect topics
- **Content Density**: Based on text amount, images, and formatting
- **Layout Factors**: Considers page size, text size, and column settings
- **Buffer Included**: Estimate includes some buffer for formatting

### Managing Content Overflow
When content exceeds your target page count:

1. **Reduce Topic Selection**
   - Deselect less critical topics
   - Focus on most important concepts
   - Remove duplicate or overlapping content

2. **Edit Content for Conciseness**
   - Convert paragraphs to bullet points
   - Remove redundant explanations
   - Focus on key facts and formulas

3. **Adjust Settings**
   - Increase page count if acceptable
   - Use smaller text size
   - Choose larger paper size
   - Use multi-column layout

## Quality Control

### Content Accuracy Review
- **Compare with Originals**: Check that extracted content matches source files
- **Verify Technical Terms**: Ensure specialized vocabulary is correct
- **Check Examples**: Confirm practice problems and solutions are accurate
- **Review Context**: Make sure content makes sense in isolation

### Organization Review
- **Logical Flow**: Ensure topics are organized in learning order
- **Appropriate Grouping**: Check that related concepts are together
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Verify main topics and subtopics make sense
- **No Orphaned Content**: Ensure all important content is included somewhere

### Completeness Check
- **All Key Concepts**: Verify important topics from source materials are included
- **Balanced Coverage**: Check that all subject areas are appropriately represented
- **Examples Included**: Ensure practice problems and examples are present
- **Reference Information**: Include formulas, definitions, and key facts

## Advanced Selection Techniques

### Cross-File Integration
When content comes from multiple files:
- **Merge Related Topics**: Combine similar topics from different sources
- **Resolve Conflicts**: Choose best version when sources disagree
- **Fill Gaps**: Use content from one source to complete topics from another
- **Maintain Attribution**: Note which sources contributed to each topic

### Topic Customization
- **Split Large Topics**: Break complex topics into smaller, focused sections
- **Merge Small Topics**: Combine related small topics for better organization
- **Create Custom Topics**: Add new topics for content that doesn't fit elsewhere
- **Reorder Content**: Arrange topics in optimal learning sequence

### Content Enhancement
- **Add Context**: Include background information for complex topics
- **Clarify Examples**: Improve example problems for better understanding
- **Include Mnemonics**: Add memory aids and study tips
- **Cross-Reference**: Note connections between different topics

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Topic Organization Problems
**Issue**: AI created topics that don't make sense for your study needs
**Solution**: 
- Manually reorganize topics using edit functions
- Merge related topics that were separated
- Split topics that contain multiple concepts
- Create new topic categories as needed

### Missing Content
**Issue**: Important information from source files doesn't appear in any topic
**Solution**:
- Check if content was extracted properly during processing
- Look for content in unexpected topic categories
- Add missing content manually to appropriate topics
- Upload additional files if content is completely missing

### Duplicate Content
**Issue**: Same information appears in multiple topics
**Solution**:
- Choose the best version and remove duplicates
- Merge topics that contain overlapping content
- Edit topics to focus on different aspects of the same concept
- Use cross-references instead of repeating information

### Content Quality Issues
**Issue**: Extracted content has errors or unclear wording
**Solution**:
