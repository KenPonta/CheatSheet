# PDF Document Processing Guide

## Overview

The study material generator can extract text and images from PDF documents, including scanned PDFs using OCR technology.

## Supported PDF Types

### Text-based PDFs
- **Best for**: Digital documents with selectable text
- **Processing**: Direct text extraction with formatting preservation
- **Quality**: Highest accuracy and fastest processing

### Scanned PDFs
- **Best for**: Scanned documents or image-based PDFs
- **Processing**: OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology
- **Quality**: Good accuracy, may require manual review

### Mixed PDFs
- **Best for**: Documents with both text and scanned images
- **Processing**: Combines direct extraction and OCR
- **Quality**: Varies by section, text areas are most accurate

## Upload Process

1. **Select PDF File**: Click "Upload Files" or drag and drop
2. **File Validation**: System checks file format and size
3. **Processing**: Text extraction and image analysis
4. **OCR Processing**: For scanned content (may take longer)
5. **Content Review**: Extracted content appears for review

## What Gets Extracted

### Text Content
- Body text and paragraphs
- Headings and subheadings
- Lists and bullet points
- Table text content
- Footer and header text

### Visual Elements
- Embedded images and diagrams
- Charts and graphs (converted to images)
- Mathematical formulas and equations
- Handwritten notes (via OCR)

### Document Structure
- Page organization
- Section hierarchy
- Table structures
- Image captions and context

## Tips for Best Results

### For Scanned PDFs
- **High Resolution**: Use 300 DPI or higher scans
- **Clear Text**: Ensure text is legible and not blurry
- **Good Contrast**: Dark text on light background works best
- **Straight Alignment**: Avoid skewed or rotated pages

### For All PDFs
- **File Size**: Keep under 50MB for optimal processing
- **Page Count**: Large documents may take longer to process
- **Language**: English text provides best OCR accuracy
- **Quality**: Higher quality PDFs produce better results

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Poor OCR Results
- **Issue**: Text extraction is inaccurate
- **Solution**: Check image quality, try re-scanning at higher resolution
- **Workaround**: Manually edit extracted text in topic selection

### Missing Images
- **Issue**: Some images don't appear in extracted content
- **Solution**: Ensure images are embedded, not linked externally
- **Workaround**: Upload images separately

### Slow Processing
- **Issue**: PDF takes long time to process
- **Solution**: Large files or many images increase processing time
- **Workaround**: Split large PDFs into smaller sections

### Formatting Issues
- **Issue**: Text layout doesn't match original
- **Solution**: Complex layouts may not preserve perfectly
- **Workaround**: Review and edit content in topic selection phase

## File Size Limits

- **Maximum Size**: 50MB per file
- **Recommended**: Under 20MB for faster processing
- **Page Limit**: No strict limit, but 100+ pages may be slow
- **Multiple Files**: Upload several smaller PDFs instead of one large file

## Security and Privacy

- **Temporary Processing**: Files are processed temporarily and not stored
- **Content Privacy**: Your document content is not saved permanently
- **Secure Upload**: Files are transmitted securely
- **Data Deletion**: All temporary files are automatically deleted after processing
