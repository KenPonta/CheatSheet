# Priority-Based Topic Selection Guide

## Overview

The priority-based topic selection system allows you to create focused compact study materials by assigning importance levels to topics and subtopics. This ensures that the most critical information is always included, even when space is limited.

## How Priority Selection Works

### Priority Levels

- **High Priority**: Essential topics that must be included in your study material
- **Medium Priority**: Important topics included when space allows
- **Low Priority**: Optional topics used to fill remaining space

### Topic and Subtopic Control

Each topic can be broken down into individual subtopics, giving you granular control over what content to include:

1. **Topic-Level Priority**: Sets the default priority for all subtopics within that topic
2. **Subtopic-Level Priority**: Override individual subtopic priorities for fine-tuned control

## Using Priority Selection

### Step 1: Review Extracted Topics

After uploading your files, the system will extract and organize content into topics and subtopics. Each topic shows:

- Topic title and preview content
- List of subtopics with individual content previews
- Estimated space requirements
- Source file references

### Step 2: Set Topic Priorities

1. Click on the priority dropdown next to each topic
2. Select High, Medium, or Low priority
3. Watch the space utilization meter update in real-time

### Step 3: Fine-Tune Subtopic Selection

1. Expand any topic to see its subtopics
2. Toggle individual subtopics on/off
3. Set different priorities for specific subtopics
4. Use the preview feature to see content before finalizing

### Step 4: Use Auto-Fill Feature

The auto-fill algorithm optimizes your selection:

1. Click "Auto-Fill" to automatically select content
2. High-priority items are selected first
3. Medium-priority items fill remaining space
4. Low-priority items are added if space allows

## Best Practices

### Setting Priorities Effectively

- **High Priority**: Core concepts, formulas, key definitions
- **Medium Priority**: Examples, detailed explanations, secondary concepts  
- **Low Priority**: Background information, additional examples

### Maximizing Space Utilization

1. Start with high-priority topics
2. Use the space utilization dashboard to monitor usage
3. Add medium-priority content until 80-90% space utilization
4. Fill remaining space with low-priority subtopics

### Handling Space Constraints

When content exceeds available space:

1. Review the overflow warnings
2. Consider reducing subtopic selections within topics
3. Increase page count if acceptable
4. Use priority-based reduction suggestions

## Space Utilization Dashboard

The dashboard shows:

- **Total Available Space**: Based on page count and formatting settings
- **Used Space**: Current selection space requirements
- **Remaining Space**: Available space for additional content
- **Utilization Percentage**: Current space efficiency
- **Suggestions**: Recommendations for optimal space usage

### Understanding Suggestions

- **Add Topic**: Suggests including additional topics when space is available
- **Add Subtopic**: Recommends specific subtopics to fill remaining space
- **Expand Content**: Suggests including more detailed content for existing topics
- **Reduce Content**: Recommends removing lower-priority items when over capacity

## Advanced Features

### Reference-Guided Selection

When using a reference study material:

1. The system analyzes the reference's content density
2. Topic extraction is adjusted to match reference patterns
3. Auto-fill considers reference organization style
4. Space calculations align with reference formatting

### Content Preview

Before finalizing your selection:

1. Use the preview feature to see formatted content
2. Check that essential information is included
3. Verify content flows logically
4. Ensure space utilization is optimal

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Auto-fill selects too much content
- **Solution**: Lower the priority of less essential topics before using auto-fill

**Problem**: Important content is being excluded
- **Solution**: Set those topics to High priority and re-run auto-fill

**Problem**: Space utilization is too low
- **Solution**: Check suggestions panel for recommended additional content

**Problem**: Content doesn't fit despite priority settings
- **Solution**: Increase page count or reduce subtopic selections within high-priority topics

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Broad**: Begin with topic-level priorities, then refine subtopics
2. **Use Preview**: Always preview before generating the final study material
3. **Monitor Space**: Keep an eye on the utilization dashboard
4. **Iterate**: Adjust priorities based on preview results
5. **Reference Matching**: Use reference templates for consistent formatting
