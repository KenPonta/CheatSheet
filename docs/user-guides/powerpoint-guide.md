- **Body Text**: Bullet points and paragraph content
- **Text Boxes**: All text elements on slides
- **Table Content**: Data from embedded tables
- **Chart Data**: Text labels and data from charts

### Visual Elements
- **Images**: Photos, diagrams, and illustrations
- **Charts and Graphs**: Converted to images with data context
- **Shapes with Text**: Text content from shapes and callouts
- **Screenshots**: Captured visual examples
- **Diagrams**: Process flows and conceptual diagrams

### Presentation Structure
- **Slide Order**: Maintains presentation sequence
- **Section Breaks**: If used, helps organize content
- **Speaker Notes**: Additional context and explanations
- **Slide Transitions**: Noted for content flow understanding

### Metadata
- **Slide Numbers**: For reference and organization
- **Presentation Title**: From file properties
- **Author Information**: If available and relevant
- **Creation Date**: For version tracking

## Upload Process

1. **File Selection**: Choose your .pptx presentation
2. **Format Validation**: Confirms PowerPoint format
3. **Slide Analysis**: Processes each slide individually
4. **Content Extraction**: Text and image extraction
5. **Structure Mapping**: Organizes content by slide sequence
6. **Context Analysis**: Identifies key concepts and examples

## Tips for Best Results

### Presentation Preparation
- **Clear Slide Titles**: Use descriptive titles for each slide
- **Readable Text**: Ensure text is large enough and high contrast
- **Embedded Images**: Make sure images are embedded, not linked
- **Speaker Notes**: Add detailed notes for additional context

### Content Organization
- **Logical Flow**: Organize slides in learning sequence
- **Consistent Layout**: Use similar layouts for related content
- **Key Points**: Highlight important information clearly
- **Examples**: Include practical examples and case studies

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Text Extraction Issues
- **Issue**: Some text appears garbled or missing
- **Solution**: Avoid complex text effects and animations
- **Workaround**: Simplify text formatting before upload

### Image Quality Problems
- **Issue**: Extracted images are low resolution
- **Solution**: Use high-resolution images in original presentation
- **Workaround**: Upload high-quality images separately

### Chart and Graph Issues
- **Issue**: Charts don't extract properly
- **Solution**: Complex charts may be converted to images
- **Workaround**: Include chart data in speaker notes

### Slide Layout Problems
- **Issue**: Complex layouts don't preserve structure
- **Solution**: Use standard slide layouts when possible
- **Workaround**: Review extracted content and reorganize as needed

### Animation and Transition Loss
- **Issue**: Animated content doesn't appear in extraction
- **Solution**: Animations are not preserved in static extraction
- **Workaround**: Ensure key information is visible without animations

## File Requirements

### Size and Format
- **Maximum Size**: 50MB per presentation
- **Required Format**: .pptx (PowerPoint 2007 or later)
- **Slide Count**: No strict limit, but 100+ slides may be slow
- **Image Content**: High-resolution images increase processing time

### Content Requirements
- **Text Readability**: Use clear, readable fonts
- **Image Quality**: Minimum 150 DPI for embedded images
- **No Password Protection**: Remove password protection before upload
- **Standard Features**: Stick to standard PowerPoint features

## Best Practices

### For Educational Content
- **One Concept per Slide**: Keep slides focused on single topics
- **Visual Examples**: Include diagrams and examples
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Build concepts across multiple slides
- **Summary Slides**: Include review and summary content

### For Study Materials
- **Key Terms**: Highlight important vocabulary and concepts
- **Practice Problems**: Include examples and exercises
- **Visual Aids**: Use diagrams to explain complex concepts
- **References**: Include source information in speaker notes

### Multiple Presentations
- **Consistent Style**: Use similar formatting across presentations
- **Complementary Content**: Ensure presentations work together
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive filenames
- **Logical Order**: Upload in learning sequence

## Content Types That Work Best

### Highly Effective
- **Concept Explanations**: Clear explanations with examples
- **Process Diagrams**: Step-by-step visual processes
- **Comparison Charts**: Side-by-side comparisons
- **Key Facts**: Important information and statistics
- **Practice Examples**: Worked examples and case studies

### May Need Review
- **Complex Animations**: Static extraction may miss context
- **Video Content**: Videos are not processed
- **Interactive Elements**: Hyperlinks and interactions are lost
- **Audio Content**: Narration and audio are not captured
- **Complex Layouts**: May require manual reorganization

## Integration with Other Files

### Combining with Other Formats
- **Word Documents**: Detailed explanations complement slide content
- **PDF Files**: Additional reading materials and references
- **Images**: Supplementary diagrams and examples
- **Excel Files**: Data and calculations referenced in slides

### Content Organization
- **Topic Alignment**: Ensure slide topics align with other materials
- **Avoid Duplication**: Remove duplicate content across files
- **Complementary Depth**: Use slides for overview, other formats for detail
- **Cross-References**: Note connections between different materials
