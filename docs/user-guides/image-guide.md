## Tips for Best OCR Results

### Image Quality
- **High Resolution**: Use at least 300 DPI for scanned images
- **Good Contrast**: Dark text on light background works best
- **Sharp Focus**: Avoid blurry or out-of-focus images
- **Proper Lighting**: Even lighting without shadows or glare
- **Straight Alignment**: Keep text horizontal and properly aligned

### Text Characteristics
- **Clear Fonts**: Sans-serif fonts generally work better
- **Adequate Size**: Text should be readable to human eye
- **Good Spacing**: Avoid cramped or overlapping text
- **Standard Languages**: English text provides best accuracy
- **Clean Background**: Minimal background noise or patterns

### Photography Tips
- **Stable Camera**: Use tripod or steady hands to avoid blur
- **Perpendicular Angle**: Take photos straight-on, not at angles
- **Full Coverage**: Ensure all important text is in frame
- **Multiple Shots**: Take several photos if lighting varies
- **Crop Appropriately**: Remove unnecessary background

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Poor OCR Accuracy
- **Issue**: Text extraction is inaccurate or incomplete
- **Causes**: Low resolution, poor contrast, blurry image
- **Solutions**: 
  - Retake photo with better lighting
  - Increase image resolution
  - Improve contrast in image editor
- **Workaround**: Manually edit extracted text

### Handwriting Recognition Problems
- **Issue**: Handwritten text not recognized properly
- **Causes**: Unclear handwriting, cursive script, poor image quality
- **Solutions**:
  - Use clear print handwriting
  - Ensure good lighting and contrast
  - Take multiple photos of same content
- **Workaround**: Type important handwritten content separately

### Mathematical Formula Issues
- **Issue**: Complex formulas not extracted correctly
- **Causes**: Special symbols, complex notation, formatting
- **Solutions**:
  - Use images with clear mathematical notation
  - Ensure symbols are well-defined
  - Consider typing complex formulas separately
- **Workaround**: Include formula explanations in text

### Large File Processing
- **Issue**: High-resolution images take long to process
- **Causes**: Large file sizes, complex content
- **Solutions**:
  - Compress images while maintaining readability
  - Split large images into smaller sections
  - Use appropriate resolution (300 DPI is usually sufficient)
- **Workaround**: Process images in smaller batches

## File Requirements

### Size Limits
- **Maximum Size**: 10MB per image file
- **Recommended**: Under 5MB for faster processing
- **Resolution**: 300-600 DPI for scanned documents
- **Dimensions**: No strict pixel limits, but larger images take longer

### Quality Standards
- **Minimum Resolution**: 150 DPI for acceptable OCR results
- **Optimal Resolution**: 300 DPI for best balance of quality and speed
- **Color Depth**: Color images supported, but grayscale often sufficient
- **Compression**: Moderate JPEG compression acceptable

## Best Practices

### For Study Materials
- **Organize by Topic**: Group related images together
- **Include Context**: Provide filenames that describe content
- **Multiple Angles**: Take photos from different angles if needed
- **Backup Text**: Keep original text files when possible

### For Handwritten Notes
- **Clear Writing**: Use clear, legible handwriting
- **Dark Ink**: Use dark pen or pencil on light paper
- **Good Spacing**: Leave space between lines and words
- **Consistent Style**: Maintain consistent writing style
- **Review Content**: Check extracted text for accuracy

### For Screenshots
- **High Resolution**: Use high-resolution display settings
- **Full Screen**: Capture full content without cropping
- **Clear Text**: Ensure text is readable at normal zoom
- **Minimal UI**: Remove unnecessary interface elements
- **Consistent Format**: Use consistent screenshot format

## Content Types That Work Best

### Highly Effective
- **Typed Documents**: Printed or digital text
- **Clear Screenshots**: Software interfaces and web content
- **Scanned Textbooks**: High-quality book scans
- **Presentation Slides**: Clear slide content
- **Forms and Worksheets**: Structured document layouts

### Moderately Effective
- **Clear Handwriting**: Neat print handwriting
- **Whiteboard Content**: Well-lit whiteboard photos
- **Simple Diagrams**: Diagrams with text labels
- **Mathematical Notation**: Basic formulas and equations
- **Table Content**: Simple tables and lists

### May Need Review
- **Cursive Handwriting**: Script or cursive writing
- **Complex Diagrams**: Detailed technical drawings
- **Poor Quality Scans**: Low-resolution or damaged documents
- **Artistic Text**: Decorative or stylized fonts
- **Multilingual Content**: Non-English text

## Integration with Other Files

### Combining with Text Files
- **Supplementary Images**: Use images to supplement text content
- **Visual Examples**: Include diagrams and illustrations
- **Reference Materials**: Add visual reference materials
- **Practice Problems**: Include example problems and solutions

### Quality Control
- **Review Extracted Text**: Always review OCR results for accuracy
- **Edit as Needed**: Correct any OCR errors before processing

3. Ensure text is properly oriented
4. Try preprocessing image (adjust contrast, brightness)
5. Consider manual text entry for critical content

### Incorrect Character Recognition
1. Review image for clarity issues
2. Check for unusual fonts or formatting
3. Verify language settings if applicable
4. Edit extracted text manually
5. Retake photo with better conditions

### Missing Content
1. Ensure all important text is visible in image
2. Check for proper framing and cropping
3. Verify image isn't corrupted or damaged
4. Try multiple photos of same content
5. Supplement with additional images if needed
