# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to create customized cheat sheets from multiple file formats (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, images, and text) by leveraging AI to extract, organize, and format content into concise study materials. The system will transcribe text from images, organize content by topics, recreate visual examples when needed, and allow users to customize the final output while maintaining fidelity to the original source material.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to upload multiple file types (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, images, text) so that I can create a comprehensive cheat sheet from all my study materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file THEN the system SHALL accept Word (.docx), Excel (.xlsx), PowerPoint (.pptx), PDF (.pdf), image files (.jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp), and plain text (.txt) formats
2. WHEN a user uploads multiple files THEN the system SHALL process all files and combine their content
3. WHEN a user uploads an unsupported file format THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the file
4. WHEN file upload exceeds size limits THEN the system SHALL notify the user of the size restriction

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to specify how many pages my cheat sheet should be so that I can control the length and density of information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects page count THEN the system SHALL offer options from 1 to 10 pages
2. WHEN a user specifies page count THEN the system SHALL optimize content distribution across the specified number of pages
3. WHEN content exceeds specified page limit THEN the system SHALL warn the user about missing content
4. WHEN a user changes page count THEN the system SHALL recalculate content distribution

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to transcribe text from images and extract content from all file types so that no information is lost during processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL use OCR to extract all visible text
2. WHEN a PDF file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract both text and images with OCR processing for image content
3. WHEN a Word document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text, formatting, and embedded images
4. WHEN an Excel file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract data from all sheets and preserve table structures
5. WHEN a PowerPoint file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text from all slides and process embedded images

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want content organized by topics and subtopics so that my cheat sheet has logical structure and flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is extracted THEN the system SHALL use AI to identify and categorize topics automatically
2. WHEN topics are identified THEN the system SHALL create a hierarchical structure with main topics and subtopics
3. WHEN organizing content THEN the system SHALL maintain the original context and meaning from source materials
4. WHEN content has overlapping topics THEN the system SHALL merge related information intelligently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all identified topics and choose which ones to include so that I can customize my cheat sheet content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN topic organization is complete THEN the system SHALL display all topics and subtopics with preview content
2. WHEN a user views topics THEN the system SHALL show checkboxes for each topic and subtopic for selection
3. WHEN a user deselects topics THEN the system SHALL remove them from the final cheat sheet
4. WHEN a user selects/deselects topics THEN the system SHALL update page count estimates in real-time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual examples and diagrams recreated when necessary so that my cheat sheet maintains educational value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system identifies example questions or diagrams THEN it SHALL recreate them using AI image generation
2. WHEN recreating images THEN the system SHALL maintain the educational purpose and accuracy of the original
3. WHEN images cannot be recreated THEN the system SHALL preserve the original image if quality is sufficient
4. WHEN recreated images are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure they fit within the cheat sheet layout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the page size and text sizing so that my cheat sheet meets my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects page size THEN the system SHALL offer standard options (A4, Letter, Legal, A3)
2. WHEN a user adjusts text size THEN the system SHALL provide options from small to large while maintaining readability
3. WHEN page size or text size changes THEN the system SHALL recalculate content fit and warn of overflow
4. WHEN formatting is applied THEN the system SHALL ensure text is neither too small to read nor too large for efficient space usage

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use another cheat sheet as a reference template so that I can maintain consistency across my study materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a reference cheat sheet THEN the system SHALL analyze its structure and formatting
2. WHEN a reference is provided THEN the system SHALL apply similar layout, font choices, and organization patterns
3. WHEN using a reference THEN the system SHALL maintain the content from user's source materials without adding external content
4. WHEN reference formatting conflicts with content THEN the system SHALL prioritize content accuracy over formatting

### Requirement 9

2. WHEN condensing content THEN the system SHALL only remove redundant words while maintaining meaning
3. WHEN the system processes content THEN it SHALL NOT add information not present in the original sources
4. WHEN paraphrasing is necessary for space THEN the system SHALL maintain technical accuracy and original intent

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be warned about content that cannot fit so that I can make informed decisions about what to include.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content exceeds page limits THEN the system SHALL display a warning with specific details about overflow
2. WHEN warning is shown THEN the system SHALL indicate which topics or sections will be truncated
3. WHEN content doesn't fit THEN the system SHALL suggest options to reduce content or increase pages
4. WHEN user proceeds despite warnings THEN the system SHALL prioritize content based on user's topic selections
