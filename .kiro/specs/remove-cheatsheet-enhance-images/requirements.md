# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing the normal cheat sheet generator functionality from the application while keeping only the compact study generator, and enhancing the image generation system to create simple, flat-line visual representations that can illustrate questions, equations, or examples in study materials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to focus solely on compact study generation, so that the interface is simplified and I don't have confusion between different generation modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL only display compact study generator options
2. WHEN I navigate through the application THEN the system SHALL NOT show any normal cheat sheet generator interfaces
3. WHEN I access API endpoints THEN the system SHALL NOT expose normal cheat sheet generation endpoints
4. WHEN I review the codebase THEN the system SHALL have all normal cheat sheet generator code removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced image generation that creates simple visual representations, so that my study materials include helpful diagrams for equations and examples.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes content with equations THEN it SHALL generate simple flat-line visual representations of the equations
2. WHEN the system encounters examples or questions THEN it SHALL create appropriate visual aids to illustrate the concepts
3. WHEN images are generated THEN they SHALL be in a simple, clean flat-line style that's easy to understand
4. WHEN visual representations are created THEN they SHALL be contextually relevant to the mathematical or conceptual content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image generator to be easily configurable, so that I can adjust the visual style and content types that trigger image generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the image generator THEN the system SHALL provide options for visual style customization
2. WHEN setting up content triggers THEN the system SHALL allow specification of which content types generate images
3. WHEN the system generates images THEN it SHALL use consistent styling across all generated visuals
4. WHEN images are created THEN the system SHALL maintain performance while generating quality visuals

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to modify and configure my generated study materials after creation, so that I can add or remove content and images to customize the final output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a study material is generated THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to modify the content
2. WHEN I want to add content THEN the system SHALL allow me to insert new sections, equations, or examples
3. WHEN I want to remove content THEN the system SHALL allow me to delete specific sections or images
4. WHEN I modify images THEN the system SHALL allow me to regenerate, remove, or add new visual representations
5. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL update the study material in real-time or provide a preview
6. WHEN I save modifications THEN the system SHALL persist the customized version for future use

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the removal process to be clean and complete, so that there are no broken references or unused code remaining in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN normal cheat sheet code is removed THEN the system SHALL update all import statements and dependencies
2. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN the system SHALL have no broken references to removed functionality
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL function without errors related to removed components
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL pass without failures related to removed cheat sheet functionality
