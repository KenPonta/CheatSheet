How many combination types we can have?

Counting 
•Assume we have a set of objects with certain properties 
•Counting is used to determine the number of these objects
Example 
Number of available phone numbers 
with 10 digits in the local calling area
Number of possible football match starters 
given the number of team members and their 
positions

Inclusion-Exclusion principle
Three Finite Sets : Example
A total of 1232 students have taken a course in Spanish, 879 have taken a 
course in French, and 114 have taken a course in Russian. Further, 103 have 
taken courses in both Spanish and French, 23 have taken courses in both 
Spanish and Russian, and 14 have taken courses in both French and Russian. 
If 2092 students have taken a course in at least one of Spanish French and 
Russian, how many students have taken a course in all 3 languages. 

Let S be the set of students who have taken a course in Spanish, 
F the set of students who have taken a course in French, 
and R the set of students who have taken a course in Russian.
Inclusion-Exclusion principle
Three Finite Sets : Example (cont.)
Solution:
Then, we have |S| = 1232, |F| = 879, |R| = 114, |S∩F| = 103, |S∩R| = 23, 
|F∩R| = 14, and |S∪F∪R| = 2092.
Using the equation 
|S∪F∪R| = |S|+ |F|+ |R| − |S∩F| − |S∩R| − |F∩R| + |S∩F∩R|
2092 = 1232 + 879 + 114 −103 −23 −14 + |S∩F∩R|
Solving for |S∩F∩R| yields 7.
